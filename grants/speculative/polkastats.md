## Project Description

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  * An indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.


 * Project's description:

Polkastats is a WebApp that displays interesting and diverse information of live Substrate based blockchains. It consumes the data from its own database, what makes it fast and responsive. It is based on Hasura backend and API.

  * Why this project is good for the ecosystem:

Polkastats project serves very useful information for validators and delegators alike. In most of cases, information shown by Polkastats is not available in any other place, whereas sometimes the information, if repeated, is presented in a more usable manner.

  * How this project will be integrated into Substrate / Polkadot:

Polkastats is natively integrated into Substrate / Polkadot networks. We run several full nodes to keep the service online.

Furthermore, it is safe to state that this project has already found a place at the community's heart. The number of visitors has been constantly increasing since Polkastats launch back in august and it is talked about in the different communication channels. Also, Polkadot has been at the center for Polkastats since its conception, so there is no doubt left about their intertwinement.

  * Why your team is interested in creating this project:

ColmenaLabs team has always been looking for the best way to contribute to blockchain projects we consider the most interesting.

Thus, we already boast of a long history of collaborations with Polkadot. 

We have translated into Spanish the Polkadot web, the wiki and a bunch of education materials. We have conducted many meetups and workshops "spreading the word" about Polkadot all over our country. We are active in PolkaDAO and have Polkadot ambassadors in our team.

## Legal Structure 
Please provide the name and registered address of the legal entity executing the project. These details can also be shared privately via the Google Form used for your application.

## Team's experience
Team ColmenaLabs has a vast expertise in blockchain technologies, conducting Ethereum meetups since earlier 2016. ColmenaLabs is also one of the most active blockchain communities of the whole Iberian Peninsula (Spain + Portugal). Our previous blockchain experience has facilitated our landing in the Proof of Stake era, where we are participating so far with great success and good reputation on many projects. We have 2 winners of the Game of Stake Hackathon, we are validating on Kusama testnet and we support Polkadot testnets since PoC-1.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Here is a reminder of the main criteria of our grants:
* Focus on Substrate / Polkadot related projects.
* Max $100k.
* Timeframe: up to 3 months is ideal.
* Open source license (the preferred license is Apache 2.0)

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product.

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone).
* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

## Future Plans
* Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information
